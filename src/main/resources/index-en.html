    <summary>But I don't enter my data anywhere, how do they get into my account?</summary>
    <p>WWhen you log into Discord, whether in the client, browser app, or elsewhere, your token is stored on your
        device. This token is used to perform actions like writing messages on Discord. In a way, the token is a
        password to perform actions on Discord.<br>These scam sites connect to Discord servers from your computer in
        order to read the data stored on your computer that is related to Discord. During this process, they also find
        your token and it is transmitted to the site operators. They then use it to distribute such links or do other
        things with it. We can't know what they do with it, but we know that they have full access to your account. If
        payment methods are linked to your Discord account, they could theoretically buy Nitro in your name and with
        your money.
    </p>

<details>
    <summary>What can I do about it?</summary>
    <p>This is relatively simple. Do not click on links where you are not 120% sure that you can trust them. The best
        protection against viruses or hackers is the human brain. As long as people on the Internet do not become more
        suspicious, such links will continue to exist, because attackers know that the weakest point of a system is the
        user.

    <summary>Detect Discord-Scam-Links: At the domain</summary>
    <p>
        For links, you can pay attention to the domain. Providers always have their own domains. For Discord, for
        example, it is discord.com or discordapp.com. Attackers try to choose domains that are as similar as possible by
        making small changes to the spelling, as this is easily overlooked. However, if you take a closer look at the
        domain, you will notice this very quickly.

    <summary>Detect Discord-Scam-Links: At the embed</summary>
    <p>
        Links are embedded in Discord. They are usually structured as follows:<br>
        Title<br>
        Description<br>
        Image<br>
        The embed from a real Discord Nitro gift has a special embed with a direct button to accept the gift that turns
        grayish when hovered over.<br>
        An example:
    <div style="display: block">
        <img style="height: 200px" src="/static/img/nitro-original.png" alt="Original Nitro Gift Link">
        <img style="height: 200px" src="/static/img/nitro_fake.png" alt="Scam Nitro Gift Link">
